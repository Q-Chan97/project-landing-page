# project-landing-page


Post-project reflection: 

I decided to go with a Scooby-Doo theme for this webpage project. Putting together all of what I learned of flexbox was a big challenge, but by the end of it the format became more and more familiar.

When I first started learning HTML and CSS with the Odin Project, I used lots of inline-blocks, width/height declarations, and measuring in ems, but now I see how that hinders responsiveness from sites.

I'x excited for more intermediate and advanced lessons in both languages and to use flexbox to it's best potential in the future.
